# Password-Strength-Meter

This is a Password Strength Meter Github page.

We have written a program in a powerful and convenient C++ programming language.Our program can evaluate the reliability of passwords entered by users, which is the main goal of the Password Strength Checker project. 
The application takes into account elements such as the length of the password, the number of unique characters and the types of characters used.
Our program has its own database that compares passwords with those entered by the user himself and if the password is repeated, we recommend changing the password to a new one.
Also, our program writes how reliable the entered password is, based on the criteria.

The Password Strength Checker project was a significant accomplishment in creating a program that effectively evaluates password strength, checks against a leaked password database, and provides feedback to users. 

The program's ability to evaluate password strength, compare against a leaked database, and provide valuable feedback contributes to improving online security and fostering responsible password practices. 
By promoting the use of strong passwords and raising awareness about the risks of weak or compromised passwords, the project has made a significant impact in creating a safer online environment.

This is for educational practice only.
